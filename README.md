## Reflection
1. **Summary**: The Industry Talk provided valuable insights into the role of ICT in transforming industries, particularly in the energy sector. The PETRONAS Digital YGP offers fresh graduates a platform to develop technical and leadership skills in areas like data analytics, cybersecurity, cloud computing, and AI.
2. **Improvement**: To improve the poster, I could include more detailed statistics or case studies about the impact of ICT in the energy sector. Additionally, I could add testimonials from past participants of the YGP to make the content more engaging.
